    This is a great start!  I'm already jealous of the sleek look of your nav bar.
    My thought is that after this header you have a nice big picture with a simple block of text, like a quote or something.
    Once we learn a bit more, you can have your nav bar links make blocks of info come in from the sides over the picture.
    For now I would think having some info under the picture would look good.
